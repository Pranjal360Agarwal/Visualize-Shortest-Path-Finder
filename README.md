# Visualize-Shortest-Path-Finder

## Overview
It is a web application designed to visualize Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path in a grid. Built with React, the application enables users to interactively set start and end nodes, add obstacles, and observe the algorithm's real-time pathfinding process.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Place start and end nodes, and add obstacles by clicking and dragging.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch the algorithm calculate the shortest path in real-time.
- **Responsive UI**: User-friendly interface for a smooth experience on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Styling for grid layout and node components.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality and Dijkstra's Algorithm implementation.
